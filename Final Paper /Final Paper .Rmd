# Introduction


#Research Questions

For this project, we worked under the direct instruction of ProPublica for their article on medical malpractice among doctors recommended to green card applicants. The question they were trying to answer with this research was *How many doctors recommended by the US government to green card applicants have outstanding malpractice suits against them?* This is the main question our research is attempting to help answer.

More specifically within this project, we are trying to answer *Who are the doctors being recommended to green card applicants, and how many are there?* As there is no reliable and searchable database released by the government or any other entity that can be compared with a list of doctors with malpractice suits against them, it is our job to create this database for the use of ProPublica in their article.


#Background/significance of the research

ProPublica is a news website that is focused on investigative journalism that "expose[s] abuses of power and betrayals of the public trust by government, business, and other institutions, using the moral force of investigative journalism to spur reform through the sustained spotlighting of wrongdoing." [@insert_citation] It was established in 2008 in New York, NY, and continues to uphold this mission statement in a variety of disciplines, including but not limited to politics, civil rights, and education.

ProPublica plans on writing an upcoming article on doctors who have malpractice claims against them, but are still being recommended to green card applicants. In order for an applicant to receive a green card, they must have an appointment and full examination with a state-sanctioned doctor. All of these recommended doctors can be found on the government's immigration website, my.uscis.gov/findadoctor.

The concern is that, because this examination is necessary for green card applicants and if something goes wrong they are concerned that may not receive their green card, there may be cases of malpractice by these doctors that go unreported by patients. ProPublica has collected testimonies of green card applicants that have experienced instances that would constitute malpractice, but did not report it to either the government or any other entity, which means that these doctors are still practicing and still being recommended by the government for these examinations.

While these testimonies appear to be the main part of the upcoming article, ProPublica would also like to include a data element by comparing doctors who are known to have malpractice suits filed against them in the past with doctors who are recommended to green card applicants via the government website. While ProPublica currently has a list of the doctors with palpractice violations, there is no reliable list of doctors approved by the goverment to give these examinations.

Our job was to collect the names and information of all of the doctors found on my.uscis.gov/findadoctor and compile them into an easily understood file that could then be compared with the preexisting list of doctors with known malpractice suits. In order to do this, we had to scrape the data found on this website.

We feel that this research is significant, because, if these violations are taking place, this is a clear violation of the safety of immigrants to this country. These people are in a vulnerable position because of their status as immigrants, and thus could be taken advantage of. If this is happening, it is important to expose it, and using tools such as data analysis, which is what ProPublica will be doing with this research, can help to accomplish this.

#Method 
We collected the doctors' data using the package rvest for web-scraping, RSelenium for web navigation and an external platform Docker for virtual interaction with the web browser.   

Docker is a platform to develop, deploy, and run applications inside containers[@insert_citation]. We were able to virtually interact with the USCIS website by connecting to a port in Docker and opening Chrome and this enabled us to control and see what was happening on the website at a given time. Initially, Docker was installed before installing and loading the needed R Packages. The command `docker run -d -p 4445:4444 selenium/standalone-chrome` was then run in the R Terminal after we had installed our packages. This command sets up the virtual Chrome container to enable interaction with the Chrome web browser. In order to check if Docker is running, one can type in `docker ps`. We eventually open the browser using RSelenium commands before scraping our data.


RSelenium is a package in R which helps one connect to a Selenium server. This server in turn connects to the Chrome web browser and hence allowed us to automate our webscraping experience. RSelenium is responsible not only for opening and closing the browser, but it allowed us to virtually navigate the web page and automatically control the scraping. This was especially useful as our website had no endpoint urls and hence could not rely on more traditional web scraping methods. In addition, it made the process of scraping the data faster as one can simply allow the code to run and scrape multiple pages without needing to manually click the specific website. 


While RSelenium was responsible for most of the web manouvering, the package we used for scraping the data from each of the pages was `rvest `. This package makes harvesting data from a website easy as it can find specific html nodes, and their children. It also allows one to use both XPaths and CSS selectors so though we eventually stuck to using basic elements, we were not limited to one option. As a side note, we chose to use CSS selectors for web navigation with the RSelenium package.


We created a function to scrape this data and took advantage of the purrr package in R to map all our scraped elements together. To clean up our data, `dplyr` and `tidyverse` were used for text-processing the such that zipcodes were in a separate column from the rest of the address in the resulting doctors' dataset. At the moment, this function is running in a for loop but will be converted to a while loop in order to allow for different state scenarios. 


The final code written to collect the doctors' information allows a user to input one zipcode at a time in order to scrape data. Once that zipcode is entered, the doctors and facilities on that web page are harvested using `rvest` before moving on to the next page. Clicking to the next page has been automated using `RSelenium` and a for loop was implemented in our code such that for a certain number of times, the website's `Next` button is clicked, moves on to the next page, scrapes that page and so on. The website itself has been written in such a way that an actual user can keep clicking to find the nearest doctors within a 500 miles radius. As such, we have also manually entered different zipcodes in different parts of the USA so as to capture all the doctors in the country and create different datasets.
